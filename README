There are 23 cell types, with some duplicate subtypes (labeled as a,b,c,d
suffixes). Note that the duplicates are largely, but not always (see
netdefs.g), functionally identical in the current instantiation. So their
division into subtypes is to facilitate potential tweaking.

Here's a flow chart. Embedded blocks are called by their parents.

run_Neocortex: wrapper to do some basic checks on paths, existence of data directory,
MPI details. Calls pgenesis Neocortex.g 

   netparams.g: defining Network cell spacings and numbers
   syncond.g: defining synaptic conductances
      
   celldefs.g: Load cell definitions

      schema to all listed cell types (except TCR/nRT which don't use cell3D):

   //synapticprobsbase.g <- commented in favor of Traub version???
   synapticprobsTraub.g: set Synaptic weight decay parameters and delays

   synapticdelays.g: Defines base synaptic delays and variability (stdev+maxdev)

   axonaldelays.g: Ditto

   netdefs.g: Establish wiring

      General schema:
      include config_neuron_x_neuron/{}_{allother}.g

      Special cases:
      IFDEF COLUMNTYPE==0
         include config_neuron_x_neuron/{}_P6RS[cd].g
      IFDEF thalamocortical==1 (only for P6RS[ab])

         include config_neuron_x_neuron/nRT_nRT.g
         

   IFDEF_GAP==1
      Gapdefs.g: This is a rat's nest of switch statements to determine which synapses
      get gap junctions. It is in dire need of reorganizing IF we ever want to use gap
      junctions. Example:

         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSa_P23RSa_Gap.g
         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSa_P23RSb_Gap.g
         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSa_P23RSc_Gap.g
         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSa_P23RSd_Gap.g

         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSb_P23RSb_Gap.g
         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSb_P23RSc_Gap.g
         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSb_P23RSd_Gap.g

         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSc_P23RSc_Gap.g
         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSc_P23RSd_Gap.g

         include config_neuron_x_neuron/P23RSd_P23RSd_Gap.g
         .

         .

   //synchansSPIKEs.g
   //randominputdefs.g
   LFP5e.g: LFP Calculation from cellular network,taken at specified point.

   IFDEF_DISPLAY==1
      (probedices.g|probedicesTraub.g)
      rasterdefspos1.g
      (probedices2.g|probedices2Traub.g)
      rasterdefspos2.g

   IFDEF_OUTPUT==1
      LFP5eASCIIwrite.g

---------------------------

I'm a little concerned about the conditionals-- even with display=0 the scripts
will crash if they can't find probedices.g, etc. Not sure if the conditionals
statements are wrong, or if Genesis evaluates everything even if it's not run.
